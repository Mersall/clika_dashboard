# Authentication and Database Issues - FIXED ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Wrong Supabase Project
- **Issue**: Your `.env` file was pointing to project `iwfgkwjqwxqbcjimqmxv` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated to correct project `mdrgxkflxurntyjtfjan` (your "Clika" project)

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch
- **Issue**: TypeScript types didn't match actual database schema
- **Fix**: Generated correct types from Supabase and updated `database.types.ts`
- **Key Changes**:
  - `difficulty_or_depth` is a string, not a number
  - `text_lines` in ad_creative is JSON, not array
  - Proper enum types for game_type, content_status, etc.

### 3. Database Query Errors
- **Issue**: Joins were failing due to permissions
- **Fix**: Removed complex joins, fetch data separately
- **Example**: HomePage now fetches sessions and content items separately

## Current Status

✅ **Authentication Working**
- User: `dashboard@clika.com`
- Password: `Dashboard2024!`
- Role: Admin

✅ **Database Connection Working**
- Connected to correct Supabase project
- All tables accessible
- RLS mostly disabled for development

✅ **All Pages Fixed**
- HomePage: Fixed joins, displays data correctly
- ContentPage: Fixed difficulty_or_depth type
- CampaignsPage: Fixed ad_creative structure
- AnalyticsPage: Using correct view types

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your dev server** to load new environment variables:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** and login fresh

3. **All CRUD operations should now work** across all pages

## Testing

Visit http://localhost:3000/debug to run diagnostics if needed.

## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file now has:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mdrgxkflxurntyjtfjan.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

This connects to your actual "Clika" project with all your data.
