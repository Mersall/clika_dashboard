# Authentication Fix Summary

## What Was Wrong
1. Your `.env` file was pointing to the wrong Supabase project (`iwfgkwjqwxqbcjimqmxv`)
2. You have two Supabase projects:
   - `clika-production` (empty, no tables)
   - `Clika` (has all your tables and data)

## What I Fixed
1. Updated `.env` file with correct credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mdrgxkflxurntyjtfjan.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1kcmd4a2ZseHVybnR5anRmamFuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTY5MzE0NDEsImV4cCI6MjA3MjUwNzQ0MX0.FAEWes2gHOvhT3fJEiNXTG_gjzRBFt-hbujREtcF86o
   ```

2. Verified user exists with admin role:
   - Email: `dashboard@clika.com`
   - Password: `Dashboard2024!`
   - Role: `admin`

3. RLS is mostly disabled on your tables (which is fine for development)

## What You Need to Do

1. **Restart your development server** to pick up the new environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Start it again
   cd /Users/mersall/Desktop/Clika/clika-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear your browser cache**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear Site Data for localhost:3000

3. **Try logging in again**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Email: `dashboard@clika.com`
   - Password: `Dashboard2024!`

## Testing Authentication

If you still have issues, go to http://localhost:3000/debug to run diagnostics.

## The Issue Explained

You were connecting to a different Supabase project that didn't exist or you don't have access to. The authentication was working but failing to fetch data because:
1. The project didn't exist
2. The anon key was for a different project
3. The tables didn't exist in that project

Now you're connected to the correct project where all your data lives.
