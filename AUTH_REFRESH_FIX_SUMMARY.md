# Authentication Refresh Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was getting stuck in an infinite "Loading authentication..." state when refreshing the page after login. Users had to manually logout from Cognito and login again.

## Root Causes Identified
1. The `onAuthStateChange` listener was not properly handling the `INITIAL_SESSION` event
2. Missing timeout mechanism to prevent infinite loading states
3. No proper error recovery when session restoration fails
4. Supabase session recovery wasn't being awaited properly

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext.tsx
- Added proper `getSession()` call on initialization to actively retrieve stored session
- Implemented a 10-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Added debug logging with `debugAuthState` function
- Improved session handling with a dedicated `handleSessionUpdate` callback
- Fixed the auth state change listener to handle all events properly
- Added proper error handling and recovery

### 2. ProtectedRoute.tsx
- Added timeout UI that shows after 5 seconds of loading
- Added "Return to login" button as a fallback option
- Improved loading state management

### 3. supabase.ts
- Enabled debug mode for better visibility into auth operations
- Added initialization logging

### 4. Debug Tools Added
- `auth-debug.ts`: Utility for logging auth state details
- `AuthDebugPanel.tsx`: Visual debug panel showing auth state in real-time
- `test-auth-simple.html`: Simple HTML page to inspect localStorage auth tokens

## How It Works Now

1. **On Page Load/Refresh:**
   - AuthContext immediately calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` to retrieve stored session
   - If a valid session exists, it's restored from localStorage
   - User profile is fetched if session is valid
   - Loading state is set to false once initialization completes

2. **Timeout Protection:**
   - 10-second timeout in AuthContext prevents infinite loading
   - 5-second UI timeout in ProtectedRoute shows recovery options

3. **Error Recovery:**
   - If session restoration fails, loading is set to false
   - Users can click "Return to login" if stuck
   - Debug panel helps identify issues

## Testing the Fix

1. Login with your credentials
2. Refresh the page - you should stay logged in
3. Check the debug panel (bottom right) to see auth state
4. Open developer console to see detailed auth logs

## Debug Commands

```bash
# Open the simple auth debug page
open test-auth-simple.html

# Check localStorage in console
localStorage.getItem('sb-mdrgxkflxurntyjtfjan-auth-token')
```

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Check if tokens are expired using the debug panel
2. Verify Supabase project settings for session duration
3. Check browser console for any CORS or network errors
4. Use the "Return to login" button as a fallback

The authentication should now properly persist across page refreshes!
